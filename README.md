# Course Policies
## Course Prerequisites
Prerequisite: DM-UY.2193 - Intro to Web Development
## Course Description
In this course, students will bridge the gap between client and server, building dynamic web application front-ends powered by back-end servers. Having access to an external computing system and a universal display medium allows both professionals and artists to create dynamic works.
## Program Learning Objectives
Students will:
- develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
- develop technical skills to realize their ideas.
- develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
- gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.
- develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.
## Course Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Design, build, and develop content for a web applications.
- Understand and implement the iterative process
- Set up servers, have servers talk to browsers, and understand how protocols work
- Create an internal developer / creative community
## Course Structure
### Lectures
Tuesdays will consist of lectures to discuss the readings and for additional teaching. Lectures will be more conversational than direct instruction so students are expected to be prepared to discuss and share their thoughts. Questions are encouraged.
### Studio Time
Thursdays will consist of mostly studio time where students will work on exercises, learn to pair program, and have short, smaller lectures based on the materials being handled in the exercises.
Readings

There is no textbook for the course. Readings will be made available in the Github repository for the course and students are responsible for checking the reading list on their own. Though there may be updates to the readings throughout the semester, there will be no updates one week before class.
## Grading & Attendance Policy
Grades will be determined by the following criteria:
- 25%: Final Project
- 20%: Midterm Project
  - Projects will be graded based on fulfilling the project criteria, demonstrating your knowledge of course materials, code quality, problem solving skills, and level of difficulty. A grading rubric will be attached to the project assignments to help students understand what is expected of them - however these projects contain a creative component and students are urged to push boundaries and experiment. The creative component is critical to attaining a maximum grade on all projects.
- 40%: Exercises (5 total exercises - 8% each)
  - Exercises will be graded based on completion of the exercise objectives
- 15%: Attendance and Participation
  - Attendance is mandatory unless excused.
  - Participation means being prepared for questions during lectures, being on task and responsive during lectures and studio sessions, and being able to help others and ask questions of the professor or others during the course.
  - Questions will be asked during the lectures and will be based on the weekly readings
### Qualitative Grading Overview
Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows. 
#### A. Excellent (90-100)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the web design and development process.
#### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.
#### C. Satisfactory (70-79)
Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of web design and development process.
#### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)
Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.
#### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)
Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.
